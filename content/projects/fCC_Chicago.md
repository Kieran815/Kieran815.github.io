Information Page for a coding group.. I pulled most of the content from the group Facebook and Twitter pages, so the About and Contact pages are fully fleshed out, with Lorem Ipsum script on the home page. Design specs from <a href="https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp Style Guide</a>
