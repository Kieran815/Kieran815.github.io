After 20 years in Sales, it was time for something different. I began coding in the Fall of 2018 and have fallen in love. After 18 months of self-study and freelancing, I took the jump and enrolled in MicroTrain's Agile Web Development Bootcamp.

I am committed to becoming a Professional Web Developer. I started out making some pretty cool front-end apps with React, then started learning Gatsby.

I mostly deploy with Firebase, but have deployed to several content mangement systems and hosting platforms. I love to rock a good JAM stack.
