My name is Kieran Milligan and I am a Freelance Web Developer. I work with small businesses by building Full-Stack web applications to help them connect with their customers. I also help them review their marketing strategies across their chosen social media platforms to get a uniform branding for their online presence.

I love what I do because it makes a world of difference to a small business owner. Being to be able to have their own websites helps to energize their business in a time of uncertainty. Engaging potential customers has become more difficult, making it more important than ever to have a dedicated website.  I also enjoy the challenges presented by making different technologies work together. Seeing the results of a finished project is one of the best feelings in the world.
